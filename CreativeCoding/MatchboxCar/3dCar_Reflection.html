  <h1>Matchbox Car Replication Project - Sophie Freedman </h1>
  <p> On this website I will describe the Matchbox Car Replicaton Project
  that introduced me to 3D design.   </p>
  <h2> Guidlines </h2>
  <p>  The project guidlines were to create a replica of a matchbox car of our choice.
  The goal was to match the dimensions of the orginal car with our 3D model,
  although the final demensions will have no impact on our grade.</p>
  <h2> Process </h2>
  <p> I started by drawing an engineering drawing of all angles of a car.
      Then, I created a file in the OnShape software where I created a rectangular prism
      with the dimensions of my car drawing. By pasting the drawings of each side onto
      the prism, I was able to cut on the outline of the drawings and delete the rest.
      After I did this, I had the car shape. My next step was adding wheels and fillets.
      I used fillets to round out the edges of my car and extruded the wheels on the side.
      I was then ready to download the file. I uploaded
      the file to the Ultimaker Cura software and printed it.
      Also, once our 3D modeling was completed, we created CAD drawings of our objects.

  <h2> Setbacks and Solutions </h2>
  <p> Although the process appears simple, I had a number of setbacks with this project.
  My main setback was that when doing the engineering drawing, I was
  at home doing virtual learning.
Instead of being able to measure the different areas of my car, I used 3 given measurements and the
rest I had to estimate. For this reason, my engineering drawing was not very exact, ultimetly giving me
issues when I pasted it onto the rectangular prism. I had to resize each of my drawings, providing me with a
much smaller car in the end. Also, during the resizing process, I wasn't able to decrease the size of my drawing
by the same amount, causing my final product to not have the exact proportions as the original.
